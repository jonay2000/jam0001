# Train

Train is a totally not esoteric programming language to help you with 
doing computations while you're on your way home in a train. 
Train models computation as train networks with trains moving through it
carrying two types of passengers. First class passengers who go to great 
lengths to describe the train they are in. Second class passengers
just try to get where they want to go and carry some data with them.

For some examples, please refer to the [shunting yard](shunting_yard)

# Compilation instructions
```bash
cargo run -- shunting_yard/truth_machine.train
```
