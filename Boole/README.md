# Train

Train is a totally not esoteric programming language to help you with 
doing computations while you're on your way home in a train. 
Train models computation as train networks with trains moving through it
carrying two types of passengers. First class passengers who go to great 
lengths to describe the train they are in. Second class passengers
just try to get where they want to go and carry some data with them.

For some examples, please refer to the [shunting yard](shunting_yard)

# Compilation instructions
```bash
cargo run -- --cli shunting_yard/truth_machine.train
```

This program uses python. By default, it calls the "python" executable, and expects at least
python 3.8. However, if your operating system sucks and only provides python 2 for instance,
or defaults to python 2 when python is called: set the "PYTHON_EXECUTABLE" environment
variable to your preferred python executable that's at least python3.8.

# LangJam

This programming language was written as a submission to the first LangJam
in the weekend of saturday the 21st of august by Noah Jadoenathmisier, 
Julius de Jeu, Jonathan Brouwer and Jonathan DÃ¶nszelmann.

# Additional Documentation
We are Dutch students, so obviously we travel a lot by train. As you know, you can do a lot of things at train stations.
